Stock Market Analysis and Time Series Prediction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (stock-market-analysis-and-time-series-prediction.ipynb) that demonstrates stock market analysis and time series prediction using Python and various libraries.


Overview
The notebook provides an extensive analysis of the stock market dataset and demonstrates how to build ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) time series prediction models for Tesla and Microsoft stocks. The notebook covers the following main sections:

Importing Libraries: The necessary Python libraries for data analysis and visualization are imported to support the analysis.

Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, clean the data, and perform any necessary data transformations. This step ensures that the data is in a suitable format for analysis and prediction.

Tesla Stock Market Analysis: Various visualizations and statistical techniques are used to explore and analyze the Tesla stock market data. This section provides insights into the historical trends, patterns, and characteristics of Tesla stock.

Tesla ARIMA Time Series Prediction: An ARIMA model is built using the statsmodels library to predict future stock prices for Tesla. The model is trained, evaluated, and used for forecasting.

Microsoft Stock Market Analysis: Similar to the Tesla analysis, this section focuses on exploring and analyzing the Microsoft stock market data using visualizations and statistical techniques.

Microsoft ARIMA Time Series Prediction: An ARIMA model is constructed using the statsmodels library to predict future stock prices for Microsoft. The model is trained, evaluated, and used for making forecasts.

Dependencies
To run the notebook successfully, you need the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
